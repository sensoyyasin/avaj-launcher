Frankfurt airport recently discovered that due to frequent weather changes they have a bottleneck on some of the landing tracks. In order to find a solution, they first need to know which scenarios create the worst bottlenecks. So they decided to use a simulator where they configure and analyze multiple scenarios and hope that this will highlight them were the real problem is.

So they reach out to their local top software shop and assign them this task. Here the chief designer starts working on the concept and after analysing all the facets of the software, he makes some design decisions which, he then passes on to you in order to create the simulator.
